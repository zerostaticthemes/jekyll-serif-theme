lead: My main interests and what you could expect.

Let's start with a quick one! The blogs below are expected to be a set of jumbled ideas from various fields I'm interested in. They will be more on the line of personal notes which should help me get into a subject quickly in the future.

My main interests are Software Development, Finance and Financial Markets, Training and Nutrition, and ... Coffee. I'll probably stick to these for most of the time.
