        <h1 class="title">Accounting</h1>

<p><img src="/images/austin-distel-nGc5RT2HmF0-unsplash.jpg" alt="Accounting Services" /></p>

  <li>To provide financial information that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the reporting entity.</li>
  <li>According to the European Accounting Association:</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="relevance">Relevance</h2>

<p>Relevance is the capacity of the financial information to influence the decision of its users. The ingredients of relevance are the predictive value and confirmatory value. Materiality is a sub-quality of relevance.</p>

<blockquote>

<h2 id="enhancing-qualitative-characteristics">Enhancing Qualitative Characteristics</h2>

<h2 id="statement-of-cash-flows">Statement of cash flows</h2>

<p>The statement of cash flows considers the inputs and outputs in concrete cash within a stated period. The general template of a cash flow statement is as follows: Cash Inflow - Cash Outflow + Opening Balance = Closing Balance</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Cash Inflow</th>
      <th>Outflow</th>
      <th>Opening Balance</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Monday</em></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tuesday</code></td>
      <td><strong>Wednesday</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> in the beginning of September, Ellen started out with $5 in her bank account. During that same month, Ellen borrowed $20 from Tom. At the end of the month, Ellen bought a pair of shoes for $7. Ellen’s cash flow statement for the month of September looks like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cash inflow: $20</li>
  <li>Cash outflow:$7</li>
  <li>Opening balance: $5</li>
  <li>Closing balance: $20 – $7 + $5 = $18</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> in the beginning of June, WikiTables, a company that buys and resells tables, sold 2 tables. They’d originally bought the tables for $25 each, and sold them at a price of $50 per table. The first table was paid out in cash however the second one was bought in credit terms. WikiTables’ cash flow statement for the month of June looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Important:</strong> the cash flow statement only considers the exchange of actual cash, and ignores what the person in question owes or is owed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="statement-of-financial-position-balance-sheet">Statement of financial position (balance sheet)</h2>

<p>The balance sheet is the financial statement showing a firm’s assets, liabilities and equity (capital) at a set point in time, usually the end of the fiscal year reported on the accompanying income statement.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>fixed assets</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>property</li>
      <li>building</li>
      <li>equipment (such as factory machinery)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>intangible assets</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>copyrights</li>
      <li>trademarks</li>
      <li>patents
        <ul>
          <li>pending</li>
          <li>international</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>goodwill</li>
</ul>

<p>Owner’s equity, sometimes referred to as net assets, is represented differently depending on the type of business ownership. Business ownership can be in the form of a sole proprietorship, partnership, or a corporation. For a corporation, the owner’s equity portion usually shows common stock, and retained earnings (earnings kept in the company). Retained earnings come from the retained earnings statement, prepared prior to the balance sheet.</p>
