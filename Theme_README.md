### License

This theme is open source under the MIT license. Please be respectful 🙏🏽

* If you fork or copy this theme please leave me as an original author in the LICENSE file on line 3 where I am listed as the author.
* Please don't create ports of this theme without at least asking me. Yes this theme is open-source but I've had several people "port" this theme (with only minor changes) and then advertise the theme as their own. Then they don't update it and it starts to get old and break etc. Now lots of people are finding these old crappy versions of the theme.
